# Psychic-Game

Use your psychic ability to guess which letter the computer chose by picking a letter yourself.  
 
 Included in the design of this game are trackers tallying all wins, losses, letters guessed and guesses the user has remaining. When the   number of guesses remaining falls to zero, the user loses. If he guesses correctly with guesses still remianing, the user wins. 
 
This Project further built upon my knowledge of javascript; i.e., (creating event listeners on the keyboard and establishing if/else statements to create the logic for the game. 

Users can get started with the game by simply clicking on a letter from the alphabet on their keyboard.
